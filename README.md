#Project Week 11, Technigo Bootcamp -  Happy Thoughts 

A project to practice React state skills fetching and posting data to an API.

## The problem

- Follow the provided design as closely as possible
- List the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom of the page (sorted)
- The thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received
- It need to have a form to post new thoughts
- Implement a heart button to send likes on a thought


Stretch goal:
- Show a count below the form input that updates as the user types and shows how many characters are remaining. Make it go red when the user has typed over 140 characters
