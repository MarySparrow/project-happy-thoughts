# Happy Thoughts Project Week 11

A project to practice React state skills fetching and posting data to an API. To copy a design s closely as possible, have the most recent messages posted from the top down. Also needed to implement a like button for the posted messages. 


## The problem

It has been challenging understanding how to divide content into different components, most of my issues was solved using StackOverflow and together with the team. 
I have a better understanding of React after doing this project as React is done in a very detailed and structued way.
